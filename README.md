# Vitalities

Vitalities is a tool that allows a patient to keep track of upcoming appointments and medical records. It allows a user to keep custom, subjective, legible notes on each doctor visit for their own reference.


## Current Features

* user can view, add, edit, and delete upcoming appointment reminders
* appointment reminders are saved in 'Medical Records' section once the appointment date has passed
* user can view, add, edit, and delete past records
